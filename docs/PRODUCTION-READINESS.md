# GoreeCloud Vault Server Production Readiness

## Status model

GoreeCloud Vault Server uses evidence-based release states. A green source build is necessary but is not production authorization.

- **Development** — implementation work may change; no production use is authorized.
- **Release Candidate** — exact source and image artifacts have passed the automated release gates and are eligible for controlled validation.
- **Stable** — the exact RC artifact has also passed supported-client, multi-user, operational, security, recovery, Glaze UI, platform-system, governance, and target-environment approval gates.

A release must not be promoted by version label alone.

## Canonical product boundary

**GoreeCloud Vault** is the single canonical current product/client family and **GoreeCloud Vault Server** is its backend service. **GoreeVault is retired** as a current product identity. Historical and compatibility-sensitive `GoreeVault`/`goreevault` identifiers may remain only where preservation is necessary for migration, rollback, interoperability, release evidence, or historical truth.

Existing workflow display names and `goreevault-stable-evidence.json` remain compatibility-era operational identifiers until separately migrated and validated. They are not current product-name exceptions.

## Mandatory GoreeCloud software gates

GoreeCloud Vault Server is a non-administrator-only, multi-user credential application. Stable requires the applicable multi-user, security, and Glaze UI gates below in addition to independent acceptance by all applicable Integral Platform Systems declared in `goreecloud.platform.yaml`.

### Multi-user readiness

Evidence must prove:

- each person uses an individual identity/account;
- private vault data remains isolated between unrelated users;
- user-owned resource authorization is enforced;
- organization and collection sharing follows explicit membership/role boundaries;
- member removal and permission changes take effect correctly;
- session/device revocation behavior is validated;
- network access is not treated as a substitute for application authentication/authorization;
- no shared administrator identity is required for ordinary user access.

### Security readiness

Evidence must prove the applicable authentication, authorization, zero-knowledge, secure secret handling, dependency/vulnerability, network exposure, privacy-conscious logging, backup/recovery, migration/rollback, and security-testing requirements in this repository.

### Glaze UI readiness

Every GoreeCloud-controlled server surface and GoreeCloud Vault user-facing interface within the approved release scope must conform to Glaze UI before Stable unless an explicit material exception has been approved under the GoreeCloud exception standard.

The bundled upstream-compatible web vault is currently a transitional compatibility dependency and **does not satisfy product-wide Glaze UI readiness**. No permanent production exception is approved by this repository. Stable is therefore blocked while that upstream presentation remains the primary browser vault.

## Integral Platform System acceptance

A GoreeCloud Stable claim also requires independent applicable acceptance for every current Integral Platform System declared by the service Platform Contract:

- **GoreeCloud Manager** — registration, health/status, lifecycle, operational control, and maintenance boundary as applicable;
- **Privacy Shield** — privacy authorization, minimization, purpose, revocation, and evidence boundary as applicable;
- **Wardveil Security** — security controls, protection evidence, threat/incident boundary, and applicable runtime acceptance;
- **Everkeep** — backup, restore, continuity, recovery, and verification boundary;
- **Glaze UI** — controlled presentation and accessibility conformance;
- **GoreeCloud Mesh** — private connectivity/service-publication boundary where applicable;
- **GoreeCloud Identity** — identity/SSO/account boundary where applicable;
- **GoreeCloud Policy** — shared policy evaluation, distribution, enforcement coordination, explanation, freshness, exception handling, and evidence where applicable;
- **GoreeCloud Observability** — privacy-minimized health, metrics, diagnostics, dependency state, alerting, operational evidence, and incident visibility where applicable.

Each system must prove its own acceptance. Another system's pass, repository CI, encryption, private networking, or a successful deployment cannot substitute for a missing acceptance record. Until qualifying evidence changes an individual state, `goreecloud.platform.yaml` must remain fail-closed and overall conformance must remain nonconformant.

## Release Candidate automated gates

The exact immutable candidate SHA must pass:

- the existing compatibility-era CI workflow, including PostgreSQL server and test-target compilation;
- source-format and template checks;
- Repository Readiness validation;
- Security Scan with zero unresolved HIGH/CRITICAL findings outside explicit, documented, expiring exceptions;
- workflow security analysis;
- black-box compatibility coverage for login, sync, CRUD, attachments, organizations/collections, TOTP, WebAuthn/passkey challenge/rejection, and refresh-token replay/concurrency behavior;
- isolated multi-user account and organization/collection authorization regression coverage;
- destructive PostgreSQL plus `/data` backup/restore rehearsal;
- Vaultwarden baseline to GoreeCloud Vault Server migration and rollback rehearsal;
- non-publishing AMD64/ARM64 release-image build;
- production Compose policy validation;
- Glaze UI source-conformance validation for GoreeCloud Vault Server-owned browser administration/error surfaces and the applicable GoreeCloud Vault presentation boundary;
- Stable-evidence schema self-tests.

Existing workflow display names retain historical `GoreeVault` identifiers until they are deliberately migrated and validated; those legacy automation identifiers do not override the canonical product or server identity.

Any code change after evidence is collected creates a new candidate SHA and requires new exact-head evidence.

## Stable governance gates

Before the first Stable release, verify all of the following in GitHub and record the result in release evidence:

- `main` is protected against unreviewed/direct release-source changes;
- required CI/status checks are enforced on `main`;
- CODEOWNERS review applies to runtime, workflow, public project identity, security, dependency, deployment, migration, test, scanner-exception, repository-readiness, and UI-conformance surfaces;
- a protected GitHub Actions `release` environment exists;
- the `release` environment requires at least one reviewer and prevents self-approval where GitHub supports it;
- default GitHub Actions token permissions are read-only;
- GitHub Dependabot vulnerability alerts are enabled;
- secret scanning and push protection are enabled where supported;
- private vulnerability reporting is enabled where supported;
- release publishing uses the protected environment and does not accept unreviewed branch builds;
- no standing temporary workflow retains unnecessary `contents: write` permission.

The current authoritative blocker record must be consulted for the latest verified GitHub governance state. Missing visibility is not a passing state.

## Stable artifact gates

Stable must use the exact RC artifact that was tested. Record:

- source commit SHA;
- multi-architecture OCI manifest digest from the canonical `ghcr.io/goreecloud/goreecloud-vault-server` repository;
- PostgreSQL image digest and version;
- browser-vault asset/client version and digest where applicable;
- Rust toolchain and lockfile state;
- release workflow run identifiers;
- security scan results and exception disposition state;
- a validated `goreevault-stable-evidence.json` attached to the matching RC GitHub release.

The `goreevault-stable-evidence.json` filename remains a compatibility-oriented evidence identifier; the canonical product is GoreeCloud Vault and the canonical backend is GoreeCloud Vault Server.

The canonical Stable evidence format and upload process are defined in `docs/STABLE-EVIDENCE.md`. The Stable release workflow must validate that file against the selected RC tag, source SHA, and OCI manifest digest before any Stable or `latest` tag is created.

Do not rebuild a different image from the same source and treat it as equivalent evidence.

## Target-environment gates

Before production publication at `https://vault.goreecloud.com`:

- production Compose validation passes with the reviewed deployment files;
- the backend is loopback-only and is not directly publicly routed;
- TLS/WSS is provided by the trusted GoreeCloud reverse proxy;
- PostgreSQL is not host-published and remains on the internal backend network;
- the server is non-root, capability-free, read-only-root, and `no-new-privileges` is active;
- public registration is closed;
- `/admin` is disabled unless a separate reviewed administrative-access change authorizes it;
- a pre-deployment backup exists and its restore procedure has been rehearsed;
- storage capacity, certificate expiry, health, restart loops, and backup completion are monitored;
- production logs have been checked for secret/data minimization;
- rollback instructions and the previous known-good digests are recorded before deployment;
- the approved private-access path is verified where it applies to administration.

## Client gates

The real supported-client matrix must be exercised against the exact GoreeCloud Vault Server candidate. At minimum record the client name, platform, exact version/build, server SHA/image digest, test time, and result for:

- sign-in and unlock;
- initial/full sync;
- create/update/delete;
- attachments;
- organization/collection behavior used by GoreeCloud;
- TOTP enrollment/use/recovery behavior;
- WebAuthn/passkey behavior on a real supported browser/device path;
- refresh-token rotation/replay behavior;
- logout and device/session invalidation behavior.

Synthetic API compatibility tests are strong release evidence but do not replace the real-client matrix. Completed real-client, WebAuthn, multi-user, target-environment, Glaze UI, and governance results must be recorded in the canonical Stable evidence asset defined by `docs/STABLE-EVIDENCE.md`. Integral Platform System acceptance is retained in each system's authoritative evidence process and cross-referenced from `docs/RC-EVIDENCE.md` or the equivalent versioned RC record; schema version 2 does not accept ad hoc platform-system fields.

## Glaze UI gates

Every GoreeCloud Vault Server-controlled server surface and every GoreeCloud Vault user-facing surface included in the product release must conform to `docs/GLAZE-UI.md`. Material UI changes require authenticated browser review at representative desktop and mobile widths in System, Light, and Dark modes, including keyboard-only operation, reduced motion, increased contrast, forced colors where practical, error states, empty states, long values, and responsive tables/forms.

The server-owned Admin and error surfaces are already subject to automated Glaze UI conformance.

The bundled upstream-compatible web vault is a temporary compatibility dependency, not a permanent production exception. Product-wide Stable promotion remains denied until **GoreeCloud Vault Web** owns the primary browser presentation under Glaze UI or a separately approved material exception satisfies the full GoreeCloud exception standard. No such exception is currently approved.

## Release decision

Stable promotion is denied if any of the following is true:

- a required workflow is failing, skipped unexpectedly, or ran against a different SHA;
- a fixed HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerability remains unresolved;
- a vulnerability exception is expired, broad, undocumented, or no longer justified;
- multi-user isolation/authorization evidence is missing or failing;
- migration, rollback, backup/restore, or real-client evidence is missing;
- an applicable Integral Platform System lacks independent accepted evidence;
- the matching RC release lacks a valid `goreevault-stable-evidence.json` or the evidence references a different source SHA/OCI manifest;
- `main` or the release environment lacks the required governance controls;
- the production backend can be reached directly from the public network;
- image references are mutable or the server image does not use the canonical GoreeCloud Vault Server GHCR repository;
- the release artifact differs from the tested artifact;
- product-wide Glaze UI conformance is not proven and no approved material exception exists;
- UI conformance or accessibility review has a material unresolved defect;
- an upstream Vaultwarden security fix applicable to the candidate has not been evaluated.
